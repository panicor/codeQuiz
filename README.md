# codeQuiz

In this homework, the user was to take a short quiz on The Office. This code involved three languages (HTML, CSS, and JS). There were multiple HTML files representing different pages for the user to browse. This project pushed us developers and forced us to apply knowledge acquired in the bootcamp. We used for loops, conditional statements, as well as newer items like local storage or DOM traversal. Traversing the DOM was definitly difficult, but I used query selectors to hook into the HTML from the JS. Overall, I needed moe time to finish some aspects, but I'm proud of what I've accomplished.
